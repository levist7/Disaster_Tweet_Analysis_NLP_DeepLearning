# Disaster Tweet Analysis Project with Natural Language Processing - Deep Learning Project

Twitter has been a key communication channel in times of emergency. The smartphones allows to announce an emergency being observed in real-time. Therefore, it serves a very useful tool for the agencies interested in programatically monitoring Twitter. Some efforts include the applications developed by disaster relief organizations and news agencies.

## Target ðŸŽ¯

Itâ€™s not always clear whether a personâ€™s words are actually announcing a disaster. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets talks about real disasters and which ones do not. 

**Dataset**

This dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their â€˜Data For Everyoneâ€™s [website]("https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/"). They hand-classified a dataset of 10,000 tweets. The dataset may contain text that may be considered as profane, vulgar, or offensive.

## Deliverables

A submission file is provided after using fitted deeplearning model on a seperate dataset including tweet texts. The submission file can be found in docs/.
